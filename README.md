## Motivation
This project was inspired by this [course](https://www.coursera.org/projects/machine-learning-for-customer-segmentation) on Coursera. This repo contains an unsupervised machine learning project using Kmeans and (PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS) PCA for the customer segmentation and dimensionality reduction respectively. Customer segmentation is important for marketers because it enables them to launch targeted ads and marketing campaigns that are tailored to customer's specific needs.
